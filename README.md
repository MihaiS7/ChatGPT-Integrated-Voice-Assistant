# ChatGPT-Integrated-Voice-Assistant

Welcome to the prototype of a new Voice Assistant integrating ChatGPT for a better user experience. This project is a personal purpose, open to improvements, ideas, and suggestions. However, its usage is intended strictly for personal purposes!

## To-Do List:

- Implement wake word functionality: Trigger the assistant by saying "Hi Buxi."
- Incorporate diverse features:
  - Ask for the current time
  - Inquire about the weather
  - Set alarms
  - Open applications or files
- Save the input and output to a CSV file for record keeping.
- Include a `requirements.txt` file.
- Ensure clean, organized code for maintainability.
